I studied engineering with a concentration in Product Design at [Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu), where I was a member of the fourth graduating class.

While at Olin, I took a year off and ended up starting [Luminaire Coffee Equipment](http://www.luminairecoffee.com) with several of my classmates. I currently work full time at Luminaire designing software and writing firmware.

Before I was full time at Luminaire, I worked as a software designer and engineer at [Involution Studios](http://www.goinvo.com) where I designed and built applications for various large companies.

Most of the content on this website is from while I was still in college.
